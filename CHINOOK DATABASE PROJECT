Wekcome to the Chinook Database Project . In this project I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to draw insights about managing a music store.
The database includes tables such as 'artistes', 'albums', 'tracks' and more.
Below are a the interesting insights I got from the database.

```ANALYSIS```
#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName,LastName, Customerid ,Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'

#2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName,LastName, Customerid ,Country
FROM customers
WHERE country ='Brazil';

#3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT C.FirstName,C.LastName,I.invoiceId,I.InvoiceDate,I.BillingCountry
FROM customers C 
JOIN invoices  I 
ON C.Customerid = I.Customerid
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%AGENT%';

#5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices;

#6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT E.FirstName,E.LastName,I.invoiceId
FROM employees E
JOIN customers C 
ON E.EmployeeId=C.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices I ON 
C.Customerid =I.Customerid;

#7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customer.

SELECT E.FirstName ||' ' ||E.LastName as SalesAgent,C.FirstName ||' ' || C.LastName AS CustomerName,C.Country, I.Total
FROM employees E
JOIN customers C 
ON E.EmployeeId=C.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices I ON 
C.Customerid =I.Customerid;

#8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate like '2009%'

#9.What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM invoices 
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID
SELECT T.Name,I.InvoiceLineId
FROM invoice_items  I
JOIN tracks T
ON I.Trackid = T.Trackid;

#11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT T.Name as Track,Ar.Name as Artist,I.InvoiceLineId
FROM Invoice_items  I
JOIN tracks T
ON I.Trackid=T.Trackid
JOIN albums A
ON T.Albumid=A.Albumid
JOIN artists Ar
ON A.Artistid=Ar.Artistid;

#12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT T.Name as Track_Name,A.Title as Album_name,M.Name as Media_type,G.Name as Genre
FROM albums A
JOIN tracks T
ON A.AlbumId=T.AlbumId
JOIN media_types M
ON T.MediaTypeid=M.MediaTypeId
JOIN Genres G
ON T.GenreId=G.GenreId;

#13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT E.FirstName,E.LastName,ROUND(SUM(I.Total),2) as Total_Sales
FROM employees E
JOIN customers C 
ON E.EmployeeId=C.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices I ON 
C.Customerid =I.Customerid
WHERE E.Title='Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY E.FirstName;

#14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT E.FirstName,E.LastName,ROUND(SUM(I.Total),2) as Total_Sales
FROM employees E
JOIN customers C 
ON E.EmployeeId=C.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices I ON 
C.Customerid =I.Customerid
WHERE E.Title='Sales Support Agent'
AND I.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY E.FirstName
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC LIMIT 1;
